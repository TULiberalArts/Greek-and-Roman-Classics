## Classics Goes Beyond The Classroom
![Colosseum Study Abroad]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Classics-Colosseum-Study-Abroad.jpg){:.img-right}
Our students go abroad to both Greece and Rome, studying in the places that gave birth to some of the world’s greatest scientists, thinkers and artists. They can also spend a summer on an archaeological dig in the Mediterranean. The location and course offerings in Rome make it extremely attractive to anyone interested in the ancient world. Students interested in studying in Rome or on another international campus are encouraged to consult with departmental faculty early in their career at Temple. For more information see the [Study Abroad](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/rome) website.

## Awards/Scholarships
Every year the department gives out the Professor Nicholas Vlachos Memorial Award for excellence in classical languages and literatures to a senior Greek and Roman Classics major. Classics students are eligible for and often win other college awards in the humanities and for service.

For a complete list of departmental and college level awards and scholarships you may be eligible for, please visit the [College of Liberal Arts Awards and Scholarships](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/about-us/resources/awards-and-scholarships?field_awards_department_nid=4589&field_awards_academics_class_value=All) page.

## Classics is a Community
Our Classics Club — open to all majors and minors — and our chapter of the national honor society for classics, Eta Sigma Phi, actively meet and hold events like lectures, movie nights and other social activities. Eta Sigma Phi members also attend a spring convention and have the opportunity to win scholarships to study in the Mediterranean.

## Eta Sigma Phi

[Eta Sigma Phi](http://www.etasigmaphi.org/) is the national honorary collegiate society for students of Latin and/or Greek. Members are elected by local chapters which have been chartered by the society. The purposes of the Society, in the words of the constitution, are “to develop and promote interest in classical study among the students of colleges and universities; to promote closer fraternal relationship among students who are interested in classical study, including inter-campus relationship; to engage generally in an effort to stimulate interest in classical study, and in the history, art, and literature of ancient Greece and Rome.”
