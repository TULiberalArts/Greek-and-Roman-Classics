## What Do Classics Majors Do after Graduation?
![Paestum Italy]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Classics-Dan-in-Paestum-Italy.jpg){:.img-right}
What careers have alumni from your undergraduate degrees or programs of study gone on to pursue?

Greek and Roman Classics offers the kind of broadly based, rigorous training that can help graduates succeed in a number of different careers. Classics majors have recently served as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, run the CIA, founded cable television networks and software companies and worked as senior correspondents for ABC News. Recent Temple Classics majors have gone on to law school, veterinary school, graduate school, business careers and teaching. One of them finished Penn law School and is now working for Senator Toomey.

By drawing upon the varied aspects of their undergraduate experience in Classics, students develop skills with language that help their written and oral expression, and acquire an ability to pick up the skills needed for a particular task – a breadth of understanding that goes beyond narrow specializing – and a curiosity that suggests the questions which critique basic assumptions.

The [Princeton Review](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-major-search?cip=161200&page=1#.UXXd7ALi75o) has recently stressed that Classics is an ideal major for students with a wide range of career aspirations, including law and medicine. View the article ["The best prospective law students read Homer?"](http://excessofdemocracy.com/blog/2014/4/the-best-prospective-law-students-read-homer) which has hard data showing that Classics majors have the highest GPAs and LSAT scores of any group.

For a list of important and distinguished people who have studied Classics as undergraduates and then gone on to careers in completely different areas, check out this article on the [Rogue Classicism](https://rogueclassicism.com/folks-you-didnt-know-maybe-had-classics-degrees/) website! Classics is an entire liberal arts education rolled into a single department and as a recent study has proved, "_[Liberal Arts Grads Win Long-Term](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/22/see-how-liberal-arts-grads-really-fare-report-examines-long-term-data)_."
